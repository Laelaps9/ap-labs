Lab 0.3
=======
## Slices
The program **slices.go** creates a matrix and adds a value to each of its elements to show an image representing those values.  

## Maps
**maps.go** receives a string, separates it in words, and counts the amount of times each word appears on that string.  

## Functoins vs Methods
**funcsVsMethods.go** simply shows the difference between the declaration and use of functions and methods.  

### Compiling and running
These 3 programs can compile and run in terminal as well as at https://play.golang.org/  
The only problem is that **slices.go** will not show the image expected in terminal, instead it shows a representation of the
matrix and its values. That is why I recommend you run this program at https://play.golang.org/  
To run any of these 3 programs in terminal you can type `go run slices.go`, `go run maps.go`, and `go run funcsVsMethods.go` respectively.
