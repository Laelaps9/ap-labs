##mycat.c
**mycat.c** is a simple program that opens a file, reads its contents and prints them in terminal. It is my take on **cat.c**. To open a file fopen() was used, after that, the program loops getting and printing each character in the file until the EOF is found.  
##Compiling and running
To compile this program simply type `make` in your terminal and the makefile will automatically compile the program and create an output file named **mycat**.  
To run this program, type `./mycat [name of file to open]`.
##Performance metrics
If you would like to know more about the performance metrics, read the **Performance.pdf** file which contains examples and a brief explanation of the results.
