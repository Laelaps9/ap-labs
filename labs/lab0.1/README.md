This program deletes the comments in any c program or any other language/text file that uses the same comments and character constants syntax. Modified files will continue to compile after their comments are deleted (only if the program compiled to begin with).
To compile you can use gcc in by typing "gcc ex1-23.c -o ex1-23" (without the quotationt marks). This creates an executable file named ex1-23. To run it simply type "./ex1-23" (again, no quotation marks). This will start the program which will ask you to type the name of the file you want to delete comments from. Type the full name and press enter. If the file you chose doesn't exist in that same directory, "File not found" will be printed on screen. If the program ran succesfully you should see "Comments deleted" printed on screen.
