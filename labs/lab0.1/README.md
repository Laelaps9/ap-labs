This program deletes the comments in any c program or any other language/text file that uses the same comments syntax. It also ignores the character constants between quotation marks to avoid deleting the strings. 
To compile you can use gcc in by typing "gcc ex1-23.c -o ex1-23" (without the quotationt marks). This creates an executable file named ex1-23. To run it simply type "./ex1-23" (again, no quotation marks). This will start the program which will ask you to type the name of the file you want to delete comments from. Type the full nameand press enter. If the file you chose doesn't exist, the program won't do anything.
