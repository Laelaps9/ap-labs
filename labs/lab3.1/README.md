# Lab 3.1
This program tracks the creations, deletions and changes in names of all the files/directories in the specified folder.
Subdirectories will also be tracked to see the changes inside of them.
## Compiling and running
To compile simply type `make` in terminal. This will create an output file named **monitor**.
To run the program type `./monitor [path to track]`. If no path is specified, the program will track the directory in which it currently is.
You can type `make clean` to delete the output files.
